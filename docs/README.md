This project is an exercise/proof of concept in implementing a full LAMP stack using Linux based EC2 virtual servers implemented through Amazon Web Services, Apache on those EC2 instances, MySQL databases, and PHP.

We would like this website to provide automobile consumers with useful and objective information. With ad-hoc querying, this integrated platform will aid automobile customers in feeling more confident in their purchase.

This repository will be used to keep track of our web application development. It is configured to be open to the public and we will be using a range of file types. These are to include HTML, PHP, CSS, and other software packages such as JQuery.
